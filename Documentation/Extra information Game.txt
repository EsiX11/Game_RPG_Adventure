Features to disguist/ to add to the list
1. Name of player as name of character
	have the name on the pamphlet change to the name that is input.
2. Items
	Every item has it's own JSON file with its information regarding the item.
	There has to be a standart way of making the items JSON file so every file is coded the same way.
	E.G:
	{
		"_itemNumber": 1,
		"_displayName": "Vote for Recardo",
		"_name": "pamphlet_1",
		"_usable": 0, #0 being no. 1 being yes.
		"_combinedUse": 0, #0 being no. 1 being yes.
		"_combinedUseWith": [Item number],
		"_itemUse":"A description of what the items does",
		"_itemSuccesfullUse":"A description of what happend after it was succesfully used",
		"_ItemFailedUse":"A description of what happened after a failed use with the item",
		"_description": "The pamphlet seems to be from some political campaign. By the looks of it its been laying here for a while. It's all crumbled"
		"_displayText": 1, #0 being no. 1 being yes.
		"_text": "The pamphlet reads: Vote for Recardo and I'll shred (players name)",
		"_reaction": 1, #0 being no. 1 being yes.
		"_reactionText": "What isn't that my name. It can't be. But it's the exact same. What's going on here.",
		"_reactionAfter": 1, #0 being no. 1 being yes.
		"_reactionAfterText": "Did they put me here? No way the wouldn't do that to another polictical Opponent would they? 
		"_extraInfo": 0, #0 being no. 1 being yes.
		"_extraInfoText":"",	
	}
	and possible other information. But every file will look the same. Even if one item doesn't have reactionText the file will just include blank.
3. Backlog
	A way for the player to read all the text that has been told to them in order it's been told to them.

4. Back and Next button in textbox
	So the system can detirement wether the player has finished the reading.
	
5. Clickable Items in the itembox
	The player can click on the name of the item to unlock a list with buttons to use with the items. E.G the read button to re-read what was on the item.

6. A welcome screen
	A page before they enter the game welcoming them.
	
7. A version number in the bottom right
	title says it all

8. As uniform as we can make it
